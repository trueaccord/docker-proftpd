## Retirement Announcement
At this point in time, we've decided to retire the docker-proftpd project and place it into maintenance mode,
and Trueaccord will no longer be managing and maintaining this project.

We'd like to extend a huge thanks and our gratitude to all of the contributors to this project that
have helped us to get this project to where it is today and for accompanying us on this journey!

If you run into any issues with this project that you believe require attention or wish to enhance
it, feel free to fork this repository however we may decide to delete this repository at a future
point in time.
